This means the format was imported incorrectly making it difficult to analyse the data. after transforming the compConcentration data to double, the data was plotted in a scatterplot graph with the data for the different compounds on the y-axis (RawData) and the varying concentrations on the x-axis (compConcentration). Each variable got a colour matching the compName and a symbol matching the expType column-values. Jitter and log10 scaling of the X axis was added, for the correct graph ## Warning: Removed 5 rows containing missing values (geom_point). Figure 1: Scatterplot displaying the amount of offspring at different concentrations per compound (colour) and experiment type (symbol) The positive control for this experiments is ethanol. The negative control for this experiment is S-medium. To analyze this experiment and learn whether there is an effect of different concentrations on offspring count and the effects of different compounds i would take these steps: -group data per compound -check if data is normally distributed -Use the appropriate statistical tests on the data to see if there is a significant difference in offspring count when using different concentrations of compounds -Calculate IC50 and create a plot of the curve For the next visualization I have normalized the data for the controlNegative in such a way that the mean value for controlNegative is exactly equal to 1 and that all other values are expressed as a fraction thereof. ## `summarise()` has grouped output by &#39;expType&#39;, &#39;compName&#39;. You can override using the `.groups` argument. expType compName compConcentration mean_RawData_normalized controlNegative S-medium 0.00e+00 1.0000000 controlPositive Ethanol 1.50e+00 0.5750873 controlVehicleA Ethanol 5.00e-01 1.0690726 experiment 2,6-diisopropylnaphthalene 4.99e-05 1.0391929 experiment 2,6-diisopropylnaphthalene 4.99e-04 0.9670159 Figure 4: Scatterplot displaying the amount of offspring at different concentrations per compound (colour) and experiment type (symbol) normalized on the negative control. this step was taken to get the result in relation to the 0 value, the amount of offspring from without any compound.

This will allow anyone who uses the repository to be able to easily find their way around the files and data.

My first big step and also my first big inspiration in regards to bioinformatics and data science is creating this digital portfolio as a result of the minor Data Science For Biology. The next skill I would like to learn is controlling a database and building interactive websites, so that people who do not know data science can still enjoy the gift as it is. I will be doing a projecticum where both of these skills will be used. I will also be doing an internship where i will be learning to use a SQL database and translate the data to my coworkers through the magic of an interactive R.shiny website.
