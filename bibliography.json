This updated overview discusses the utilization of compound libraries, compounds derived from combinatorial and parallel synthesis campaigns and natural product sources; creation of mother and daughter plates; and compound storage, handling, and bar coding in HTS. The unit also presents an overview of established and emerging assay technologies (i.e., time-resolved fluorescence, fluorescence polarization, fluorescence-correlation spectroscopy, functional whole cell assays, and high-content assays) and their integration in automation hardware and IT systems. This revised unit provides updated descriptions of state-of-the-art instrumentation and technologies in this rapidly changing environment. The section on assay methodologies now also covers enzyme complementation assays and methods for high-throughput screening of ion channel activities. Finally, a section on criteria for assay robustness is included discussing the Z'-factor, which is now a widely accepted criterion for evaluation and validation of high throughput screening assays.","author":[{"family":"Entzeroth","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Flotow","given":"Horst"},{"family":"Condron","given":"Peter"}],"citation-key":"entzerothOverviewHighthroughputScreening2009","container-title":"Current Protocols in Pharmacology","container-title-short":"Curr Protoc Pharmacol","DOI":"10.1002/0471141755.ph0904s44","ISSN":"1934-8290","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009,3]]},"language":"eng","page":"Unit 9.4","PMID":"22294406","source":"PubMed","title":"Overview of high-throughput screening","type":"article-journal","volume":"Chapter 9"},
  {"id":"garnettSystematicIdentificationGenomic2012","abstract":"Clinical responses to anticancer therapies are often restricted to a subset of patients. In some cases, mutated cancer genes are potent biomarkers of response to targeted agents. To uncover new biomarkers of sensitivity and resistance to cancer therapeutics, we screened a panel of several hundred cancer cell lines, which represent much of the tissue-type and genetic diversity of human cancers, with 130 drugs under clinical and preclinical investigation. In aggregate, we found mutated cancer genes were associated with cellular response to most currently available cancer drugs. Classic oncogene addiction paradigms were modified by additional tissue-specific or expression biomarkers, and some frequently mutated genes were associated with sensitivity to a broad range of therapeutic agents. Unexpected relationships were revealed, including the marked sensitivity of Ewing’s sarcoma cells harboring the EWS-FLI1 gene translocation to PARP inhibitors. By linking drug activity to the functional complexity of cancer genomes, systematic pharmacogenomic profiling in cancer cell lines provides a powerful biomarker discovery platform to guide rational cancer therapeutic strategies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,6,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Garnett","given":"Mathew J."},{"family":"Edelman","given":"Elena J."},{"family":"Heidorn","given":"Sonja J."},{"family":"Greenman","given":"Chris D."},{"family":"Dastur","given":"Anahita"},{"family":"Lau","given":"King Wai"},{"family":"Greninger","given":"Patricia"},{"family":"Thompson","given":"I.

  {"id":"hughesPrinciplesEarlyDrug2011","abstract":"Developing a new drug from original idea to the launch of a finished product is a complex process which can take 12-15 years and cost in excess of $1 billion. The idea for a target can come from a variety of sources including academic and clinical research and from the commercial sector. It may take many years to build up a body of supporting evidence before selecting a target for a costly drug discovery programme. Once a target has been chosen, the pharmaceutical industry and more recently some academic centres have streamlined a number of early processes to identify molecules which possess suitable characteristics to make acceptable drugs. This review will look at key preclinical stages of the drug discovery process, from initial target identification and validation, through assay development, high throughput screening, hit identification, lead optimization and finally the selection of a candidate molecule for clinical development.","author":[{"family":"Hughes","given":"J.

  {"id":"lauVitroVivoDrug2021","abstract":"Biomarkers which better match anticancer drugs with cancer driver genes hold the promise of improved clinical responses and cure rates. We developed a precision medicine platform of rapid high‐throughput drug screening (HTS) and patient‐derived xenografting (PDX) of primary tumor tissue, and evaluated its potential for treatment identification among 56 consecutively enrolled high‐risk pediatric cancer patients, compared with conventional molecular genomics and transcriptomics. Drug hits were seen in the majority of HTS and PDX screens, which identified therapeutic options for 10 patients for whom no targetable molecular lesions could be found. Screens also provided orthogonal proof of drug efficacy suggested by molecular analyses and negative results for some molecular findings. We identified treatment options across the whole testing platform for 70% of patients. Only molecular therapeutic recommendations were provided to treating oncologists and led to a change in therapy in 53% of patients, of whom 29% had clinical benefit. These data indicate that in vitro and in vivo drug screening of tumor cells could increase therapeutic options and improve clinical outcomes for high‐risk pediatric cancer patients., A precision diagnostic platform integrating genomics and transcriptomics with drug testing of patient's primary tumor cells in high throughput drug screening (HTS) and patient‐derived xenograft (PDX) was established to improve identification of therapies in high‐risk pediatric cancer patients.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,6,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Lau","given":"Loretta M S"},{"family":"Mayoh","given":"Chelsea"},{"family":"Xie","given":"Jinhan"},{"family":"Barahona","given":"Paulette"},{"family":"MacKenzie","given":"Karen L"},{"family":"Wong","given":"Marie"},{"family":"Kamili","given":"Alvin"},{"family":"Tsoli","given":"Maria"},{"family":"Failes","given":"Tim W"},{"family":"Kumar","given":"Amit"},{"family":"Mould","given":"Emily V A"},{"family":"Gifford","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Chow","given":"Shu‐Oi"},{"family":"Pinese","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Fletcher","given":"Jamie I"},{"family":"Arndt","given":"Greg M"},{"family":"Khuong‐Quang","given":"Dong‐Anh"},{"family":"Wadham","given":"Carol"},{"family":"Batey","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Eden","given":"Georgina"},{"family":"Trebilcock","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Joshi","given":"Swapna"},{"family":"Alfred","given":"Stephanie"},{"family":"Gopalakrishnan","given":"Anjana"},{"family":"Khan","given":"Aaminah"},{"family":"Grebert Wade","given":"Dylan"},{"family":"Strong","given":"Patrick A"},{"family":"Manouvrier","given":"Elodie"},{"family":"Morgan","given":"Lisa T"},{"family":"Span","given":"Miriam"},{"family":"Lim","given":"Jin Yi"},{"family":"Cadiz","given":"Roxanne"},{"family":"Ung","given":"Caitlin"},{"family":"Thomas","given":"David M"},{"family":"Tucker","given":"Katherine M"},{"family":"Warby","given":"Meera"},{"family":"McCowage","given":"Geoffrey B"},{"family":"Dalla‐Pozza","given":"Luciano"},{"family":"Byrne","given":"Jennifer A"},{"family":"Saletta","given":"Federica"},{"family":"Fellowes","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Fox","given":"Stephen B"},{"family":"Norris","given":"Murray D"},{"family":"Tyrrell","given":"Vanessa"},{"family":"Trahair","given":"Toby N"},{"family":"Lock","given":"Richard B"},{"family":"Cowley","given":"Mark J"},{"family":"Ekert","given":"Paul G"},{"family":"Haber","given":"Michelle"},{"family":"Ziegler","given":"David S"},{"family":"Marshall","given":"Glenn M"}],"citation-key":"lauVitroVivoDrug2021","container-title":"EMBO Molecular Medicine","container-title-short":"EMBO Mol Med","DOI":"10.15252/emmm.202114608","ISSN":"1757-4676","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,20]]},"page":"e14608","PMCID":"PMC8988207","PMID":"34927798","source":"PubMed Central","title":"In vitro and in vivo drug screens of tumor cells identify novel therapies for high‐risk child cancer","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8988207/","volume":"14"},

  {"id":"wongDrugScreeningCancer2017","abstract":"Precision Medicine in Oncology requires tailoring of therapeutic strategies to individual cancer patients. Due to the limited quantity of tumor samples, this proves to be difficult, especially for early stage cancer patients whose tumors are small. In this study, we exploited a 2.4 × 2.4 centimeters polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) based microfluidic chip which employed droplet microfluidics to conduct drug screens against suspended and adherent cancer cell lines, as well as cells dissociated from primary tumor of human patients. Single cells were dispersed in aqueous droplets and imaged within 24 hours of drug treatment to assess cell viability by ethidium homodimer 1 staining. Our results showed that 5 conditions could be screened for every 80,000 cells in one channel on our chip under current circumstances. Additionally, screening conditions have been adapted to both suspended and adherent cancer cells, giving versatility to potentially all types of cancers. Hence, this study provides a powerful tool for rapid, low-input drug screening of primary cancers within 24 hours after tumor resection from cancer patients. This paves the way for further technological advancement to cutting down sample size and increasing drug screening throughput in advent to personalized cancer therapy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,6,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Wong","given":"Ada Hang-Heng"},{"family":"Li","given":"Haoran"},{"family":"Jia","given":"Yanwei"},{"family":"Mak","given":"Pui-In"},{"family":"Martins","given":"Rui Paulo da Silva"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Yan"},{"family":"Vong","given":"Chi Man"},{"family":"Wong","given":"Hang Cheong"},{"family":"Wong","given":"Pak Kin"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Haitao"},{"family":"Sun","given":"Heng"},{"family":"Deng","given":"Chu-Xia"}],"citation-key":"wongDrugScreeningCancer2017","container-title":"Scientific Reports","container-title-short":"Sci Rep","DOI":"10.1038/s41598-017-08831-z","ISSN":"2045-2322","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,8,22]]},"page":"9109","PMCID":"PMC5567315","PMID":"28831060","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Drug screening of cancer cell lines and human primary tumors using droplet microfluidics","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5567315/","volume":"7"},
